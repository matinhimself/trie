# Student-Manager

My project for my university's **Data Structure** course. The Goal was creating a system for managing lots of students. so I implemented a HashTable to store the Students Data by student id as keys, And a trie tree to store HashTable's keys.

## Test
Run all test(contains a collision test):

`go test -v ./test/`


## Run 
 `go run ./cmd/`
